Complex AI Component
The enemy ships will utilize the main AI components within the game. We plan to implement prioritization and pathfinding algorithms.

The first AI enemy, the Stealer, recognizes areas on the map with the most resources and moves to that location utilizing a pathfinding algorithm. The second AI enemy, the Shooter, will utilize a prioritization algorithm that dictates what the enemy should shoot at based on location, player health, and base health.
